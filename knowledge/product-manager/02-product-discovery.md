# Product Discovery

## Discovery là gì?

**Product Discovery** là quá trình tìm hiểu và validate:
- Problems worth solving
- Solutions users want
- Business viability
- Technical feasibility

**Mục tiêu:** Giảm thiểu risk trước khi invest vào development.

## Tại sao Discovery quan trọng?

- **80% products fail** - Mostly do build wrong thing
- **Waste less resources** - Don't build features nobody wants
- **Faster to market** - Validate before committing
- **Better outcomes** - Solutions that actually work

## Discovery Framework

### 1. Opportunity Assessment

**4 câu hỏi quan trọng:**

1. **What problem are we solving?** (Customer pain)
2. **For whom are we solving it?** (Target market)
3. **How big is the opportunity?** (Market size)
4. **How will we measure success?** (Metrics)

### 2. Customer Development

**Talk to users:**
- Conduct user interviews (10-20 people minimum)
- Observe user behavior
- Analyze support tickets
- Review analytics data

**Good questions:**
- "Tell me about the last time you [did X]..."
- "What's the hardest part about [doing Y]?"
- "How do you currently solve this problem?"
- "What would make your life easier?"

**Avoid leading questions:**
- ❌ "Would you use a feature that does X?"
- ✅ "How do you currently handle X?"

### 3. Problem Validation

**Validate the problem exists:**

1. **Evidence of pain** - Users actively seeking solutions
2. **Frequency** - Problem occurs regularly
3. **Willingness to pay** - Users would pay to solve it
4. **Current workarounds** - Hacky solutions exist

**Red flags:**
- Users say "nice to have" instead of "must have"
- No current workarounds or alternatives
- Problem only occurs rarely

### 4. Solution Exploration

**Diverge → Converge:**

**Diverge (Generate options):**
- Brainstorming sessions
- Design sprints
- Competitive analysis
- Best practices research

**Converge (Narrow down):**
- Feasibility assessment
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Strategic alignment
- User feedback

### 5. Prototyping

**Types of prototypes:**

1. **Paper Sketches** - Fastest, cheapest
2. **Wireframes** - Low-fidelity mockups
3. **Clickable Prototypes** - Figma, InVision
4. **MVPs** - Minimum viable products
5. **Beta Releases** - Limited release

**Fidelity tradeoff:**
- Low fidelity = Fast, cheap, less realistic
- High fidelity = Slow, expensive, more realistic

### 6. Testing & Validation

**Methods:**

**Qualitative:**
- User interviews
- Usability testing
- Think-aloud sessions
- Concept testing

**Quantitative:**
- Landing page tests
- A/B tests
- Fake door tests
- Smoke tests

**Metrics to track:**
- Interest level (clicks, signups)
- Willingness to pay (pre-orders)
- Comprehension (can users explain it?)
- Satisfaction (NPS, CSAT)

## Discovery Techniques

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

**Framework:** "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]"

**Example:**
- When I'm running late for work
- I want to grab breakfast quickly
- So I can arrive on time without being hungry

### User Story Mapping

1. Map user journey horizontally
2. Stack alternative solutions vertically
3. Prioritize by value + effort
4. Slice into releases

### Assumption Mapping

1. List all assumptions
2. Rate by: Importance × Uncertainty
3. Test high-importance, high-uncertainty first

**Example assumptions:**
- Users will pay $10/month
- Integration with Slack is critical
- Mobile app needed before web

## Discovery Anti-Patterns

❌ **Building in a vacuum** - No user research
❌ **Asking users what they want** - They don't know
❌ **Analysis paralysis** - Endless research, no action
❌ **Confirmation bias** - Only seeking validating data
❌ **Feature factory** - Building without discovery

## Continuous Discovery

**Discovery is ongoing, not a phase:**

- Weekly user interviews
- Regular usability testing
- Constant analytics monitoring
- Frequent A/B testing
- Iterative prototyping

**Teresa Torres' framework:**
- Interview customers weekly
- Map opportunities
- Test multiple solutions
- Measure outcomes

## Tools for Discovery

**Research:**
- UserTesting.com
- Lookback.io
- Maze.design

**Prototyping:**
- Figma
- InVision
- Framer

**Analytics:**
- Mixpanel
- Amplitude
- Google Analytics

**Surveys:**
- Typeform
- SurveyMonkey
- Google Forms

## Discovery Deliverables

1. **Opportunity Brief** - Problem statement + market
2. **User Research Report** - Interview insights
3. **Personas** - Target user profiles
4. **Journey Maps** - User flows and pain points
5. **Prototypes** - Clickable designs
6. **Test Results** - Validation data
7. **Go/No-Go Recommendation** - Build or kill decision

## Red Flags to Kill a Project

- Users don't have the problem
- They have it but don't care enough
- Current solutions are "good enough"
- Market too small
- Technically impossible or too expensive
- Doesn't align with strategy

## Success Criteria

**Good discovery leads to:**
- ✅ Validated problem-solution fit
- ✅ Clear target market
- ✅ Evidence users want it
- ✅ Feasible to build
- ✅ Business model makes sense
- ✅ Team confident in direction
